# Fibonacci Invariants

Recall the definition of the Fibonacci series: the first number is 0, the second
1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers preceding it.
Implement a function that computes the Fibonacci numbers recursively, storing
the results in an array.

For example, the return value of `fib(7)` is the following array:

| index |  0  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| value |  0  |  1  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  5  |  8  |  13 |

Add your code in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided some basic
testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

## Invariant

What is a good invariant for your recursive implementation of `fib()`
i.e. something that is always true at the beginning of the recursive call?

Hint: Think about what the "state of the world" is here and what you can say
about it at the start of each recursive call. Your invariant must say something
about the current recursive call.

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. You do not need to prove that the invariant is correct. Add
your answer to this markdown file.

##Answers 
The time invariant makes sure that before calculating the numberfor index I, the previous values have been calculated and stored becasue they are imporant for the next value 
to be correct. In my code it makes sure that when it calls computeFib(i) that j<=i-1 so the time inaviant is for each index i, all Fibonacci numbers up to i-1 have been computed and stored in fibArray before computing fibArray[i]. This relationship checks that it has been calculated and stored in the array, if it has not been then it will continue to calculate the value. This is doing it in order with i-1 and i-2 then storing the value in an array.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-fibonacci-series/, I liked how they used the idea of an array to store previous values, it is where I got the array idea.
